- Data Science Technique(s)
- Potential Difficultie(s)
- Final Product 
- Timeline

<div class="notes">
Agenda of the presentation
  - We are going to introduce the problem statement and briefly emphasize the importance of the problem
  - Next we will focus on the avaialble data to address said problem and discuss potential data science methods which can be utilised
  - Lastly we will spend some time describing our Final deliverable(s) and the Timeline for the project
</div>

## Why is this important
- Individuals and Policy makers
- Post COVID-19 economy

<div class="notes">
- Data is used across the globe by industries to tackle everyday problems like; finding the quickest route home, tracking one's food deliveries etc.
- Decisions and future planning for both individuals and policy makers can be approached in the same vein
- With COVID-19 governing our economy and life, even more important to understand the evolution of the city and leverage that to predict potential future outcomes
- Important to understand how the landscape of neigbourhoods have evolved over the past and may change in future
- One way to gauge this, could be to track the evolution of business(s) in these neighbourhood(s), allocation of public funds etc.
</div>

## Research Question(s)
- Will a business renew their license in the coming year?
- How likely is it that a business will renew their license?
- Geospatial summary of Vancouver's business landscape

<div class="notes">
- Will a business be able to renew their license in the coming year?
- Numerous factor(s) like the type of the business, it's location, access to public trnasportation, scale of the business etc. affect this outcome
- Geospatial summary of Vancouver's business landscape
</div>

## Dataset Overview
- **Licence dataset from 1997 to 2020**
  - Business type 
  - Location
  - Number of employees

```{r, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=3.5}

#read in dataset
all_licences_group <- read_csv("../data/processed/licences.csv")

# filter for smaller dataset
filtered_df <- all_licences_group %>% 
  filter(BusinessType %in% c('Health Services', 'Landscape Gardener', 'Computer Services', 'Animal Services')) %>% 
  filter(LocalArea %in% c('Arbutus-Ridge', 'Downtown', 'Fairview', 'Kitsilano'))

# plot counts of business types by area
filtered_df %>% ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=filtered_df$BusinessType, 
               fill=filtered_df$BusinessType),
           show.legend = FALSE) +
    labs(x='Business Type', 
       y='Count', 
       title = "Counts of Business Types in Vancouver Neighbourhoods",
       caption = "Data Source: opendata.vancouver.ca     ") +
  facet_grid(.~filtered_df$LocalArea) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25,hjust = 1),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        panel.background = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
        axis.line = element_line(colour = "black")) 
```

<div class="notes">
- Our main dataset we will utilize in this project comes from the Vancouver Open Data Catalog
- This dataset is spread across two files and consists of all Vancouver Business Licence 
applications from 1997 to current
- The most prominent features in this dataset are the business type, the business location, and number of employees
- After wrangling the data, we also expect to extract additional features 
such as, the number of similar business in the surrounding area 
- The bar plot shown on this slide is from a small subset of the data, it visualizes the number of different businesses by type and neighbourhood
</div>


## Dataset Overview
- **Census local area profile**
  - Population density
  - Average household income
  - Average age group
  - Ethnicity

## Potential Future Dataset(s)
 
```{r, out.width = "800px"}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/flowchart.png")
```  
  
## Data Science Techniques
  - Data synthesis
  - Modeling using Postgres
  - Baseline model: 
    - Logistic regression
  - Advance modeling: 
    - Machine Learning and Simulations
  - Further direction: 
    - Survival analysis
  - Geospatial visualization:
    - Python and Altair/Leaflet
  - Deploy with Dash on Heroku
  
## Potential Difficulties
- Identify and address any existing geospatial and temporal correlation between the variables
- Current variables may be proxies
  - Number of employees -> Captial invested
- Combine features from different data sources

## Final Product
- A data pipeline
- A geospatial visualization of Vancouver's business landscape

    options = layersControlOptions(collapsed = TRUE)
  )
```

<div class="notes">
Final product will be designed to answer both research questions effectively.
  - Vancouver map to show all descriptive information
  - Side panel to show modeling results
