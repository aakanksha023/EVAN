knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Goal of the project
- Understand how Vancouver business's have evolved in the past
- How they may change in future?
- Can this information be used to drive decision making?

## Research Question
- How long will a particular Vancouver based business stay in operation?
- Geospatial summary of Vancouver's business landscape

## Dataset Overview
- Licence dataset from 1997 to 2020
  - Business type 
  - Location
  - Number of employees
  - Number of similar business (after wrangle)
  
```{r, message=FALSE, comment=FALSE, echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,error=FALSE}

train <- read_csv("../data/processed/licence_train.csv")
train %>% 
  select(2,7,9,10,11,12,13,17,18,21,22,23) %>% 
  head(8)
```

## Dataset Overview
- Census local area profile
  - Population density
  - Average household income
  - Average age group
  - Household size
  - Ethnicity
  
  **insert plot for dataset here**
  
## Potential future dataset(s)
  - Access to public transportation 
  - Parking space
  - Rent per sq./ft 
  - Construction in the neighbourhood
  - Time taken to approve minor renovations
  - Registered capital
  - Franchise or not
  
## Data Science Technique(s)
  - Data wrangling and database creation using Postgres
  - Baseline model: 
    - Logistic regression
  - Advance modeling: 
    - Random forest, Regularization
  - Further direction: 
    - Survival analysis
  - Geospatial visualization:
    - Python and Altair/Leaflet
  - Deploy with Dash on Heroku
  
## Potential difficulties
- Identify and address any existing temporal correlation between the variables
- Current variables may be proxies
- Combine features from different data sources

## Final product
- A data pipeline
- A geospatial visualization of Vancouver's business landscape
