## Executive Summary

A brief and high level summary of the project proposal.

## Introduction

  - Start broad, introducing the question being asked/problem needing
    solving and why it is important.

  - Indicate the refined tangible objectives
    
      - Reasoning for why these scientific objectives are useful for
        addressing the capstone partner’s needs.

  - Might need to describe the available data first before outlining the
    objectives.

## Data Science Methods

  - Describe the data science techniques you used to address the
    objectives.
  - Pros and cons of using this method
  - Justification over other methods
  - Possible improvements
      - Difficulties associated with making these improvements, and why
        you didn’t implement the improvements.

## Data Product and Results

  - Describe your data product and results  
  - For the description of the data product, you might want to include:
      - How you intend the partner to use the data product
      - Pros and cons of using this product/interface
      - Justification over other products/interfaces
      - Possible improvements
          - Difficulties associated with making these improvements, and
            why you didn’t implement the improvements.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

  - **Restate the question being asked/problem needing solving**
    
      - **explain how your data product answers it**
